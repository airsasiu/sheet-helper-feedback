# sheet-helper-feedback - README.md
Welcome to the **sheet-helper-feedback** repository!  

This space is dedicated to collecting your valuable input for **SheetHelper**‚Äîour free Excel/Google Sheets tutorial website. Whether you want to request a specific tutorial, ask a spreadsheet question, report a site bug, or share ideas to improve the experience, this is the right place to contribute. Your feedback directly shapes the content and features we build next.


## What We‚Äôre Collecting Here
To keep feedback organized and actionable, we focus on three core areas. Please align your submissions with these categories:

### 1. Tutorial Requests  
Do you have a specific Excel/Google Sheets topic, function, or task you‚Äôd like us to cover? Examples include:  
- "How to use INDEX-MATCH across multiple sheets"  
- "Google Sheets: Automate data entry with Form Responses"  
- "PivotTable hacks for monthly sales reports"  

Share the topic, and we‚Äôll prioritize it for future content.


### 2. Spreadsheet Questions  
Stuck on a real-world Excel/Sheets problem? Need clarification on a feature? Examples include:  
- "Why does my VLOOKUP return #N/A even when the value exists?"  
- "How to merge cells in Google Sheets without losing data?"  

We‚Äôll respond directly with a solution (when possible) or turn your question into a step-by-step tutorial for others to learn from.


### 3. Website Issues & Suggestions  
Experiencing bugs, broken links, or usability pain points on SheetHelper? Or have ideas to make the site better? Examples include:  
- Issues: "The ‚ÄòDark Mode‚Äô button doesn‚Äôt work on the ‚ÄòExcel Formulas‚Äô page"  
- Suggestions: "Add a ‚ÄòSave Tutorial‚Äô button to bookmark favorite guides"  

Your input helps us fix problems fast and build features you‚Äôll actually use.

## How We Manage Your Feedback
We want you to know your input doesn‚Äôt get lost‚Äîhere‚Äôs our process:  

1. **Triaging (1‚Äì3 Business Days)**:  
   We‚Äôll review your issue within 1‚Äì3 days, add a label (e.g., `tutorial-request`, `website-bug`), and ask for more details if needed.  

2. **Prioritization**:  
   We prioritize issues based on:  
   - Popularity: Click the üëç button on an issue to show support‚Äîmore upvotes = higher priority.  
   - Relevance: How many users the topic/issue will help (e.g., a "VLOOKUP guide" helps more people than a niche macro tip).  
   - Urgency: Critical bugs (e.g., broken pages) are fixed faster than minor suggestions (e.g., UI tweaks).  

3. **Updates & Closure**:  
   - **Tutorial Requests**: We‚Äôll update the issue when the tutorial is planned or published (with a direct link to the guide on SheetHelper).  
   - **Questions**: We‚Äôll respond with a solution or link to a tutorial (existing or new) that answers your question.  
   - **Issues/Suggestions**: We‚Äôll update you when a bug is fixed or a suggestion is implemented.  
   - Closed issues: Issues are closed once resolved. If we can‚Äôt address a request (e.g., overly niche topics), we‚Äôll explain why in the comments.
