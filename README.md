# Excel Site Feedback
Welcome to the **excel-site-feedback** repository! This space is dedicated to collecting your valuable input to improve our Excel tutorial website and shape the content we create. Whether you have an Excel question you want turned into a tutorial, a suggestion for the site, or a bug to report, this is the right place to share.
## What We‚Äôre Collecting Here
We welcome three main types of feedback‚Äîplease focus your submissions on these areas to help us stay organized:

1.  **Excel Tutorial Requests**
    Do you have a specific Excel topic, function, or task you‚Äôd like us to cover in a tutorial? (e.g., "How to use VLOOKUP for multiple sheets," "PivotTable tips for beginners")
2.  **Excel Questions**
    Stuck on a specific Excel problem or need clarification on a feature? Share your question here, and we‚Äôll aim to address it (either in a tutorial or a direct response).
3.  **Website Issues & Suggestions**
    Experiencing bugs, broken links, or usability issues on our Excel tutorial site? Or have ideas to improve the site (e.g., better search, more video tutorials)? Let us know!

## Issue Templates & Guidelines
To keep feedback actionable, we use templates for different feedback types. Please select the template that matches your submission:

    *   Any specific scenarios or examples you‚Äôd like included?
### 2. Excel Question Template

*   **Description**:

    *   Clearly explain your Excel problem (step-by-step if possible).
    *   Include screenshots (if applicable) to show the issue (e.g., error messages, messy data).
    *   What have you tried so far (to avoid duplicate suggestions)?

## How We Manage & Respond to Issues
We follow a clear process to ensure your feedback is addressed promptly:

1.  **Triaging (1‚Äì3 Business Days)**
    Our team will review new issues within 1‚Äì3 business days and add a **label** to categorize them (e.g., `tutorial-request`, `excel-question`, `website-bug`). We may also ask for more details if your submission is incomplete.
2.  **Prioritization**
    Issues are prioritized based on:
*   Popularity (number of "upvotes" üëç from other users‚Äîclick the üëç button on an issue to show support).
*   Relevance (how many users the topic/issue likely affects).
*   Urgency (e.g., critical website bugs are fixed faster than minor suggestions).
1.  **Updates & Closure**
*   For **tutorial requests**: We‚Äôll update the issue when the tutorial is planned or published (with a link to the tutorial).
*   For **Excel questions**: We‚Äôll either respond directly with a solution or link to a relevant tutorial (existing or new).
*   For **website issues**: We‚Äôll update the issue when the bug is fixed or the suggestion is implemented.
*   Issues will be closed once resolved. If we can‚Äôt address a request (e.g., overly niche topics), we‚Äôll explain why in the comments.
## Code of Conduct
We want this space to be respectful and inclusive for everyone. By submitting feedback, you agree to:

*   Be clear and constructive (avoid vague or offensive language).
*   Focus on the topic (no off-topic requests, spam, or self-promotion).
*   Respect our team‚Äôs response time (we‚Äôll do our best to address all valid feedback).
